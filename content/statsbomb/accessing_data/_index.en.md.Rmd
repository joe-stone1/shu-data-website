Statsbomb kindly provide a range of data sets at no cost. An overview of the available data can be found here: [Free Data](https://statsbomb.com/what-we-do/hub/free-data/). The code below can be ran in R to see which specific competitions and data sets you can access. 

First the installation of the StatsBombR package is required

However, if the package comes via Github we use the devtools package to install it. Devtools allows for downloading of packages directly from Github. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#To install the package in R, you will need to install the Devtools package, which can be done by running the following line of code:
install.packages("devtools") 
install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_version("SDMTools", "1.1-221")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Then to install StatsBombR run:
devtools::install_github("statsbomb/StatsBombR")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(StatsBombR)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r comp, eval=FALSE}
#Loads competitions which are available
Comp <- FreeCompetitions() #this gives you the competitions ids used below
view(Comp)
```
